# We are using VScode in the cloud for CS50.
# So right now I have my own code space in the cloud
# We have our files, we have a terminal window / Command line interface
# Have our own server too, running it's own OS. Can install own programs on it etc.
# It's running linux

# Worth learning a few linux commands
code hello.py   # Creates a file called hello.py
python          # Runs python
python hello.py # Runs my program in python

# I can interact with my files from the top left of the screen in normal ways I would with any GUI.
# Or by using commands
ls
cp
mv
rm
mkdir
cd
rmdir
clear
