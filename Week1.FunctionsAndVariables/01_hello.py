print("hello, world")

#To run, use:
#python hello.py
#this makes python the nterpreter of the .py file
#And we're using the predefined function, print

#And we pass an input to the function. The input is an argument.
#It displays the input on the screen as a side effect.

#Bugs - various and many
#Would occur if we did this instead
#print("hello, world"
#No closing parenthesis
