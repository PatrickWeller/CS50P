# Integers are whole numbers
# we also use symbols + - * / and %  (% allows you to get remainders)

# Can open python by itself in the terminal by just typing python in the terminal
# Then in interactive mode for immediate stuff. Can copy and paste some of these operations into there

#Input assigns numbers enterred to be strings, we need them to be integers though
#x = input("What's X? ")
#y = input("What's Y? ")

#Converts string x and string y into integers
#z = int(x) + int(y)

#print(z)


# But we are really using the z integer past this point

# Improvements
x = int(input("What's X? "))
y = int(input("What's Y? "))

print(x + y)
