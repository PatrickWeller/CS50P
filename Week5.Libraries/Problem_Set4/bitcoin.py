# bitcoin price index - bitcoin.py

# Bitcoin is a form of digitial currency, otherwise known as cryptocurrency.
# Rather than rely on a central authority like a bank,
# Bitcoin instead relies on a distributed network,
# otherwise known as a blockchain, to record transactions.

# Because thereâ€™s demand for Bitcoin (i.e., users want it), users are willing to buy it,
# as by exchanging one currency (e.g., USD) for Bitcoin.

#In a file called bitcoin.py, implement a program that:

# Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins,
# n, that they would like to buy.
# If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
# Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json,
# which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float.
# Be sure to catch any exceptions.

# Outputs the current cost of Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using a comma as a thousands separator.
