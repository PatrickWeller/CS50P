# Frank, Ian and Glen's letters
# Figlet

# FIGlet, named after Frank, Ian, and Glenâ€™s letters,
# is a program from the early 1990s for making large letters out of ordinary text,
# a form of ASCII art:

# _ _ _          _   _     _
#| (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
#| | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
#| | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
#|_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/
# Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at figlet.org/examples.html.

# FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called pyfiglet.

# In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:

# * Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
#       *Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
#       *Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font,
#        in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font,
#        and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
# * Prompts the user for a str of text.
# * Outputs that text in the desired font.

# If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font
# or the second is not the name of a font,
# the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.

# pip install pyfiglet
